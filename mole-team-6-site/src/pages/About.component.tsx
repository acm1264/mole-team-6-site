                Mole Team 6 is a small indie studio building fast-paced,
                retro-style multiplayer games. Weâ€™re passionate about couch
                co-op chaos and creating memorable moments with friends.

                Our first title is a competitive bullet hell arena brawler where
                reflexes and power-ups collide in colorful, over-the-top
                showdowns. Stay tuned for more updates and behind-the-scenes!
